     <p class="text-white mb-2">
        Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' 
        personal information to others. We share customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries CineHolic.com, Inc. controls 
        that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

         <li class="text-white"><strong class="pr-2">Transactions involving Third Parties:</strong> We make available to you services, products, 
            applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through CineHolic Services. For example, you can order products from 
            third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable 
            third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, 
            such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third 
            party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.
         </li>
         <li class="text-white"><strong class="pr-2">Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform

            and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, 
            and providing customer service. These third-party

         </li>
         <li class="text-white"><strong class="pr-2">Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy 
            other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but 
            remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). 
            Also, in the unlikely event that CineHolic.com, Inc. 
            or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

         <li class="text-white mb-2"><strong class="pr-2">Protection of CineHolic and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information
